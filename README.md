#**Maya Angelou** 

##I have chosen to speak about Maya Angelou as she motivated the world by her acts and words. After facing so many challenges in her life, she came back stronger and tenacious. She never lost hope and kept on trying hard. As being one of the captivating and inspirational women, she used the power of her words and attracted millions of people. Maya Angelou taught me the message of being the best person I can be – that means chasing my dreams and believing in my one true vision. Accomplishing this with compassion, kindness, and with insight. Going forth and let my solitary fantasy transform as many realities as possible for the better.  

###One of Maya Angelou’s quotes that has elevated and assisted me with obstacles is *You will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated* This has taught me that one of the reasons for living our life is to face challenges. And to learn from them. I believe the first way in not allowing yourself to be defeated is by recognizing challenges will occur.
